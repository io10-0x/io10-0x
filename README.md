# About Me

Hello! I'm a Web3 Security Researcher and Blockchain Developer with a passion for decentralized technologies and smart contract development. My journey into the blockchain world began with a fascination for how decentralized systems can change the world and I want to be a part of it.

## My Focus
- **Smart Contract Security & Auditing**: I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities and securing smart contracts to prevent exploits. My expertise includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Utilizing tools like Slither to analyze smart contracts for potential weaknesses.

- **Manual Reviews**: Conducting in-depth reviews of Solidity codebases to detect logic errors, privilege escalations, and other vulnerabilities.

- **Security Research**: Staying up to date with the latest smart contract hacks and exploits to continuously improve my security methodologies.

- **Smart Contracts**: I specialize in writing and deploying secure and efficient smart contracts using Solidity. My repositories include a variety of projects that demonstrate my understanding of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications.
  
- **Full Stack Development**: I am also working on expanding my expertise to cover the full spectrum of blockchain development. This includes not only smart contract development but also integrating them with web3 front-ends, building user-friendly DApps, and managing the backend infrastructure that supports these applications.

## Technologies I Work With

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Hardhat, Truffle, Brownie, Foundry, Huff
- **Tools & Libraries**: Web3.js, Ethers.js, IPFS, Ganache, Metamask

## Projects

In my repositories, you'll find a variety of smart contracts and DApps I've been developing to hone my skills. From basic ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens to more complex DeFi protocols, each project reflects my commitment to mastering the blockchain development lifecycle. You will also find repositories of protocols I have audited with all my commented lines of code and my thought processes all jotted down in the code. If you are looking for a summary of the audits I have done, you can find my reports/ findings from public competitions in my auditnotes repository which includes all of my findings from previous competitions as well as key notes that can be transferred to other audits which help me constantly improve. 

## My Vision

I am committed to contributing to the blockchain space by developing applications that push the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized technologies. My main goal is to be able to understand most smart contract languages on a deep level starting with Solidity and progressing on to Vyper and Rust. I believe that skills are worth more than money as skills are non transferable so which money is a good motivator and essential, I want to ensure that I am growing with any work I am doing. I enjoy challenges as I feel I can push myself and learn more as I go along. My goal is to become a proficient security researcher who consistently wins public contests and also have a very strong client base of business partners who value and trust my skills to deliver top level audits on their protocols. I  full stack blockchain developer who can bring innovative ideas to life, whether it's through personal projects or by collaborating with others in the community.
